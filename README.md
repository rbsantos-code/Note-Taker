## Goals
* I want to be able to write and save notes that I type into this application
* When I click on the link to the notes page, I want to be presented with a page with exisiting notes listed on the left side
* When I enter a new title and notes text, I could save the text by pressing the save icon
* When I want to delete an existing notes in the application, I could do so by pressing the trash icon next to the saved text
